/*
 * 
 * Assume you are an awesome parent and you want to give your children some
 * cookies. But you have a goal: to maximize the number of children who get
 * their favorite cookie.
 * 
 * Each child i has a greed factor g[i], which is the minimum size of a cookie
 * that the child will be content with; and each cookie j has a size s[j]. If
 * s[j] >= g[i], we can assign cookie j to child i, and the child will be
 * content. Your goal is to maximize the number of children who are content with
 * their cookies.
 * 
 * Return the maximum number of children you can satisfy (i.e., the maximum
 * number of children who can get their favorite cookie).
